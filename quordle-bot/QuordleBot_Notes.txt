QuordleBot guessed the following on java version 1.0:

ninth
Word 2 (ninth) guessed in 5 tries.
avian
Word 3 (avian) guessed in 6 tries.
excel

For a total of 22

However, after guessing "gaily" the list of words was as follows:
["twice", "thief", "quite", "thick", "white"] //length = 5
["tunic", "ninth"]//length = 2
["china", "avian"]//length = 2
["cluck", "flume", "bleed", "belch", "pluck", +23 more] //length = 28

Switching that word to "china" gave:
snort
gaily
china (Manually chosen)
thick
Word 1 (thick) guessed in 4 tries.
ninth
Word 2 (ninth) guessed in 5 tries.
avian
Word 3 (avian) guessed in 6 tries.

Can't say definitively, because results could differ on subsequent guesses with different words, but seems like guessing a possible word in this scenario likely gives a better expected outcome than not.

For third guess:
vouch is rated as 3.4771428571428578,
china -> 2.3571428571428577,
ninth -> 1.6721428571428574,
avian -> 1.0071428571428571,
tunic -> 1.797857142857143

if possible words are multiplied by (1 + 1/possibleword.length),
china would be ~3.5357, so better than vouch, which seems warrented here.

Note: the difference between Quordle wordlist and Wordle wordlist is Quordle list contains 6 additional words, most of
which are somewhat offensive.  Also, Quordle list has KAPUT while wordle has CAPUT.
